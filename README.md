Issue
For the purpos to resolve the Syntax error of IE compatibility Issue
I have tried to use Ts-loader to transform typeScript code to es6 js code, and then use Babel-loader to transform es6 js code into es5 code. 
After that , I will  not see the code like "Export class xxxxxx" in it, bug still can see es6 code , such as "=>"
